"""Constants for CLI Agent Orchestrator (CAO) application.

This module defines all configuration constants used throughout the CAO application,
including directory paths, server settings, and provider configurations.

The CAO application orchestrates multiple CLI-based AI agents (Kiro CLI, Claude Code,
Codex, Kimi CLI, Q CLI) through tmux sessions, providing a unified interface
for agent management.

# StatusMonitor buffer, and GET /terminals/{id}/output all stall on stale
# content indefinitely (pane_pipe still reports 1; nothing errors). The
# FifoManager watchdog compares tmux's live pane content against whether the

# check sees the identical content as the last, "diverged_from_baseline" is
# always False, and the watchdog can wait forever without ever re-arming —
# meanwhile wait_for_shell() times out (60s default) waiting for a FIFO
# buffer that was never going to fill. This is a separate, positive check:
# has the FIFO delivered ANYTHING at all since the terminal was registered?
# If not, and this much time has passed, and the live pane already has real
# content (ruling out "still genuinely booting, nothing to show yet"), the
# forwarder never started forwarding in the first place — re-arm immediately

# period forever: a successful rearm() doesn't mark the FIFO as having
# delivered — only the reader thread pulling a real byte off it does — so

# Client-side HTTP timeout (seconds) for the BLOCKING ``POST /workflows/runs`` call
# (workflow_run MCP tool + ``cao workflow run`` CLI). Unlike the quick cancel/status
# reads, this request awaits ``start_run`` INLINE — the server holds the connection
# open for the WHOLE run (Q1=A, §8), so a flat ``MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`` (=30s) would
# raise ``requests.Timeout`` and report a still-running run as a failure.
#
# The strict worst case is ``WORKFLOW_STEP_TIMEOUT * WORKFLOW_MAX_STEPS`` (600s * 100
# = 60000s ~= 16.7h) plus per-step ready-wait/reprompt headroom — an impractically
# long socket timeout that would also mask a genuinely hung server for hours. We pick
# a defensible ceiling instead: a generous-but-realistic multi-step run (each step a
# full ``WORKFLOW_STEP_TIMEOUT`` plus the substrate's ~120s ready-wait, across a dozen
# steps) plus the same +180s headroom ``handoff`` uses for its single blocking step
# (mcp_server/server.py ``client_timeout = timeout + 180.0``). This is clearly NOT the
# flat 30s and covers any plausible multi-step, multi-minute workflow; an operator
# running near the 100-step ceiling can raise it via the env override if needed.
